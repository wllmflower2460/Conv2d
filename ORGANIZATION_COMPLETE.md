# Conv2d Project Organization Complete

## ✅ Organization Summary

The Conv2d project has been reorganized for better structure and maintainability.

### 📁 New Structure Created

### 🚀 Files Moved

#### Documentation (41 → organized)
- **Architecture docs** → `docs/architecture/`
  - CONV2D_ARCHITECTURE_DOCUMENTATION.md
  - Conv2d-VQ-HDP-HSMM_Implementation_Roadmap.md
  - API_REFERENCE.md
  
- **Deployment docs** → `docs/deployment/`
  - DEPLOYMENT_QUICK_REFERENCE.md
  - EDGE_PI_DEPLOYMENT_SUCCESS.md
  - HAILO_ARCHITECTURE_FIX.md
  - MOVEMENT_INTEGRATION_README.md
  
- **Theory docs** → `docs/theory/`
  - T0_1_THEORY_GATE_RESPONSE.md
  - T0_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md
  
- **Status reports** → `docs/status/`
  - All M1_6_*.md files
  - All TRAINING_STATUS*.md files
  - All FSQ_*.md and VQ_*.md analysis files

#### Scripts (35 → organized)
- **Training scripts** → `scripts/training/`
  - All train_*.py files (8 files)
  
- **Evaluation scripts** → `scripts/evaluation/`
  - All evaluate_*.py files
  - All test_*.py files
  - Benchmark and monitoring scripts
  
- **Deployment scripts** → `scripts/deployment/`
  - All deploy_*.py files
  - All export_*.py files
  - Hailo preparation scripts

#### Results & Logs
- **JSON results** → `results/`
- **Training logs** → `results/training/`
- **Ablation studies** → `results/ablation/`

#### Model Files
- **Checkpoints** → `models/`
  - All .pth files
  - All .onnx files

### 🧹 Cleanup Benefits

1. **Root directory**: Reduced from ~80+ files to ~10 essential files
2. **Better organization**: Clear separation of concerns
3. **Easier navigation**: Logical grouping by function
4. **Preserved structure**: Important existing folders maintained
5. **Archive created**: Old work preserved but out of the way

### 📍 Quick Access Paths

```bash
# Training scripts
cd scripts/training/

# T0.5 documents
cd Shared/Conv2D/Agent_Reviews/

# Model checkpoints
cd models/

# Evaluation results
cd results/

# Architecture docs
cd docs/architecture/
```

### 🎯 Next Steps

1. Update any scripts that reference old paths
2. Consider creating a Makefile for common operations
3. Add .gitignore entries for results/ if needed
4. Document the new structure in main README.md

### ⚠️ Important Folders Preserved

- `Shared/Conv2D/` - All T0 gate reviews and unified research
- `preprocessing/` - Data preprocessing pipeline
- `hailo_export/` - Hailo deployment assets
- `CoreML_Pipeline/` - iOS integration
- `quadruped_data/` - Dataset storage

The project is now much better organized for continued development!
