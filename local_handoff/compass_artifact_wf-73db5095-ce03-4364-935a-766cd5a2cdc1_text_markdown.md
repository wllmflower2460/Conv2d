# Stable alternatives to VQ-EMA for classification tasks with exploding losses

Your VQ-EMA codebook collapse with losses reaching 10^13 represents an extreme manifestation of a fundamental incompatibility between vector quantization dynamics and classification objectives. Based on comprehensive research across theoretical foundations and practical implementations, I've identified multiple stable alternatives with concrete solutions for your 128D encoder outputs.

## FSQ emerges as the optimal codebook-free solution

Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) from Google DeepMind fundamentally solves codebook collapse by eliminating the codebook entirely. Instead of learning high-dimensional vectors, FSQ projects features to a low-dimensional space (typically 4-8 dimensions) and quantizes each dimension independently to fixed scalar levels.

The mathematical elegance lies in its simplicity: given your 128D encoder output, FSQ applies a projection to 6-8 dimensions, bounds each dimension using tanh, then rounds to predefined levels. The implicit codebook emerges as the Cartesian product of per-dimension quantization levels - for instance, levels=[8,8,8,5,5,5] creates 64,000 unique codes without any learnable parameters.

**Practical implementation for your 128D features:**

```python
import torch
from vector_quantize_pytorch import FSQ

class FSQClassifier(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim=128, levels=[8,8,8,5,5,5], num_classes=10):
        super().__init__()
        # Project 128D to FSQ dimensions
        self.projector = torch.nn.Sequential(
            torch.nn.Linear(input_dim, 256),
            torch.nn.ReLU(),
            torch.nn.Dropout(0.1),
            torch.nn.Linear(256, len(levels))
        )
        self.quantizer = FSQ(levels=levels)
        self.classifier = torch.nn.Linear(len(levels), num_classes)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        projected = self.projector(x)  # 128D → 6D
        quantized, indices = self.quantizer(projected)
        return self.classifier(quantized), quantized, indices
```

FSQ achieves **100% codebook utilization** consistently, requires no auxiliary losses, and shows only 0.5-3% performance reduction compared to VQ-VAE in extensive testing. The `lucidrains/vector-quantize-pytorch` library provides production-ready implementations.

## RVQ provides multi-scale stability through progressive refinement

Residual Vector Quantization addresses codebook collapse through hierarchical quantization layers, each refining the residual from previous layers. This approach transforms the single large optimization problem into multiple smaller, more tractable ones.

The key insight: instead of finding the single best codebook vector, RVQ applies sequential quantizers where `quantized = Q1(x) + Q2(x - Q1(x)) + Q3(x - Q1(x) - Q2(x))`. Each layer captures different granularities of information, preventing the mode collapse that plagues single-codebook approaches.

**Implementation for classification:**

```python
from vector_quantize_pytorch import ResidualVQ

rvq = ResidualVQ(
    dim=128,
    num_quantizers=4,      # 4 sequential quantizers
    codebook_size=256,      # 256 codes per quantizer
    kmeans_init=True,       # K-means initialization
    threshold_ema_dead_code=2  # Replace dead codes
)

# In your model
quantized, indices, commit_loss = rvq(features)
```

Research from SoundStream and recent ERVQ papers demonstrates **>90% codebook utilization** across all layers, with 45% improvement in perceptual loss compared to VQ-EMA. The multi-scale approach naturally distributes the representational burden, avoiding the winner-take-all dynamics that cause collapse.

## Theoretical analysis reveals fundamental mismatch

The collapse you're experiencing stems from what researchers call "disjoint codebook optimization" - only selected codebook vectors receive gradients through the commitment loss, creating a feedback loop where strong codes dominate while others atrophy. The mathematical formulation shows that for optimal utilization, the selection matrix should converge to identity, but in practice only a small subset ever updates.

Three critical factors exacerbate this in classification:

1. **Sharp decision boundaries** from cross-entropy loss create steep gradients that push embeddings toward class centroids, causing multiple classes to collapse to single codes
2. **Straight-through estimator errors** compound in high dimensions - the gradient approximation becomes increasingly inaccurate as dimensionality grows
3. **Softmax overconfidence** in classification creates winner-take-all dynamics where gradient mass concentrates on dominant codes

The 128D space particularly suffers because Voronoi cell volumes grow exponentially, making stable nearest-neighbor assignment nearly impossible. Your exploding losses indicate the optimization entering a degenerate state where the encoder and quantizer fight against each other.

## Successful production implementations reveal key patterns

PTQ4ViT demonstrates near-lossless quantization (<0.5% accuracy drop) on ImageNet using twin uniform quantization and Hessian-guided metrics. Google's AQT achieves 2x training speedup on 16B parameter models. Meta's quantized Llama models show 41% memory reduction with minimal quality loss.

Critical success factors across implementations:
- **Codebook dimension reduction**: Project 128D features to 32-64D codebook space
- **Dead code replacement**: Monitor and replace unused codes every 2-3 iterations  
- **K-means initialization**: Start from data-driven centroids rather than random
- **Multiple smaller codebooks**: Use 4×256 rather than 1×1024 codes

## Gumbel-Softmax enables differentiable discrete representations

As an alternative to the straight-through estimator, Gumbel-Softmax maintains full differentiability while achieving discrete representations through temperature-controlled sampling:

```python
class GumbelSoftmaxClassifier(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim=128, num_categories=32):
        super().__init__()
        self.encoder = torch.nn.Linear(input_dim, num_categories)
        self.temperature = 1.0
        
    def forward(self, x):
        logits = self.encoder(x)
        if self.training:
            # Differentiable sampling during training
            samples = torch.nn.functional.gumbel_softmax(
                logits, tau=self.temperature, hard=False
            )
        else:
            # Hard sampling during inference
            samples = torch.nn.functional.one_hot(
                logits.argmax(dim=-1), num_classes=num_categories
            ).float()
        return samples
```

Temperature annealing from τ=5.0 to τ=0.1 provides smooth transition from exploration to exploitation, avoiding the gradient sparsity issues of VQ-EMA.

## Two-stage training decouples learning from quantization

Train your classifier first with continuous representations, then add quantization as a regularizer in stage 2. This approach provides stable initialization before introducing the discrete bottleneck:

```python
class TwoStageClassifier(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim=128):
        super().__init__()
        self.stage = 1  # Start continuous
        
    def forward(self, x):
        features = self.feature_extractor(x)
        if self.stage == 1:
            return self.classifier(features)  # Continuous
        else:
            quantized = self.quantize(features)  # Add quantization
            return self.classifier(quantized)
```

This progressive approach maintains accuracy while gradually introducing discretization, avoiding the immediate collapse you're experiencing.

## Product Quantization offers orthogonal stability

Product Quantization splits your 128D features into independent subspaces (e.g., 8 subspaces of 16D each), each with its own codebook. This orthogonal decomposition prevents total collapse - even if one subspace fails, others maintain representation:

```python
# Using Faiss for product quantization
import faiss

pq = faiss.ProductQuantizer(128, 8, 8)  # 128D, 8 subspaces, 8 bits each
pq.train(training_features)
codes = pq.compute_codes(features)
```

The exponential effective codebook size (256^8 for 8 subspaces) with linear memory makes PQ particularly suitable for high-dimensional classification features.

## Practical recommendations for immediate implementation

Given your specific situation with 128D features and catastrophic VQ-EMA failure, I recommend this prioritized approach:

1. **Start with FSQ** using `levels=[8,8,8,5,5,5]` - it cannot collapse by design and requires minimal code changes
2. **If FSQ's low dimensionality is limiting**, implement RVQ with 4 quantizers of 256 codes each
3. **For existing trained models**, apply two-stage training to gradually introduce quantization
4. **Consider Gumbel-Softmax** if you need differentiable discrete variables rather than vector quantization

The fundamental issue is that VQ-EMA's optimization dynamics are incompatible with classification objectives. FSQ sidesteps this entirely through fixed quantization grids, while RVQ distributes the problem across multiple manageable subproblems. Both achieve the discrete representations you need without the catastrophic instability you're experiencing.

## Conclusion

Your VQ-EMA collapse represents a well-documented failure mode when applying generative quantization techniques to discriminative tasks. The solutions exist not in tweaking VQ-EMA parameters but in fundamentally different approaches that maintain discrete representations without learnable codebooks or that distribute quantization across multiple stages. FSQ's elegant simplicity and guaranteed stability make it the optimal starting point for resolving your immediate crisis while maintaining the benefits of discrete representations in your classification pipeline.
