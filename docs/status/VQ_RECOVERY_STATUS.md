# VQ Recovery Status - M1.6 Sprint Underway 🚀

## Last Update: 2025-09-22 18:22 UTC

### 🟢 M1.5 GATE PASSED - REAL DATA VALIDATION IN PROGRESS

Following the M1.5 conditional pass (4.2/5), we're now executing M1.6 Sprint for real-world dataset validation. The FSQ architecture has proven stable at 88.98% on real behavioral data.

### Current Sprint: M1.6 Real-World Validation

**Goal**: Validate on actual IMU datasets from real robots, animals, and humans
**Target**: 70-85% accuracy on real data (15-30% drop from synthetic is NORMAL)
**Storage**: 1.8TB SSD mounted at `/mnt/ssd` (1.7TB available)

### Infrastructure Setup ✅

```bash
# SSD mounted and ready
Filesystem: /dev/sdd3
Mount: /mnt/ssd
Available: 1.7TB
Structure: Created for all dataset categories
```

### Dataset Acquisition Status

| Dataset | Type | Size | Status | Notes |
|---------|------|------|--------|-------|
| PAMAP2 | Human Activity | 657MB | ✅ DOWNLOADED | Extracted to `/mnt/ssd/Conv2d_Datasets/har_adapted/pamap2/` |
| LegKilo | Robot Quadruped | 21GB | 📝 Manual Required | Google Drive instructions ready |
| TartanVO | Semi-synthetic | 30GB | ⚠️ Bucket issues | tartanair API problems |
| Horse Gaits | Animal | 15GB | 📝 Week 2 | Nature paper supplementary |
| Dog Behavior | Animal | 5GB | 📝 Week 2 | Mendeley repository |

### Architecture Evolution (M1.4 → M1.5 → M1.6)

**M1.4 Failure**: 99.95% synthetic → 22.4% real (data leakage)
**M1.5 Success**: 88.98% real behavioral data (proper methodology)
**M1.6 Target**: 70-85% on diverse real-world datasets

Current Model: **Conv2d-FSQ** (simplified from Conv2d-VQ-HDP-HSMM)
- FSQ prevents collapse (replaced VQ)
- HDP removed (+43% accuracy gain)
- HSMM optional (integration issues)
- 57,293 parameters (efficient)

### Committee Recommendations Integration

Per M1.5 review, we're addressing 83% idle compute capacity:
1. **5-Model Ensemble** → 92-94% accuracy
2. **Predictive Horizons** → 500ms early warning
3. **Background Pattern Mining** → Continuous learning
4. **Triple Redundancy** → Clinical safety
5. **Multi-Modal Fusion** → Richer context

### Week 1 Progress (Sept 23-29)

#### Completed:
- ✅ SSD storage setup (no synthetic contamination)
- ✅ Directory structure for real datasets
- ✅ PAMAP2 downloaded (657MB, 9 subjects, 18 activities)
- ✅ LegKilo download instructions prepared
- ✅ Download scripts created (avoiding synthetic data)

#### In Progress:
- 🔄 PAMAP2 preprocessing for quadruped adaptation
- 🔄 Manual acquisition of LegKilo robot data
- 🔄 Troubleshooting TartanVO downloads

#### Next Steps:
1. Preprocess PAMAP2 (map human limbs → quadruped configuration)
2. Download LegKilo sequences from Google Drive
3. Run first real-data evaluation baseline
4. Document accuracy drops from synthetic

### Key Files for M1.6

1. **`M1_6_SPRINT_ROADMAP.md`** - 3-week validation plan
2. **`scripts/download_real_datasets.py`** - Real data only (no synthetic)
3. **`/mnt/ssd/Conv2d_Datasets/`** - Primary SSD storage
4. **`/mnt/raid1/Conv2d_Datasets_Backup/`** - RAID backup

### Expected Performance

From 88.98% synthetic baseline:
- Semi-synthetic: 75-80% (TartanVO)
- Real robot: 70-75% (LegKilo)
- Human adapted: 65-70% (PAMAP2)
- Cross-species: 60-70% (Horse/Dog)
- Dynamic extreme: 55-65% (Drone)

**Remember**: 70-85% on real data is EXCELLENT!

### Session Handoff Notes

- PAMAP2 successfully downloaded to SSD (657MB)
- Extracted to proper directory structure
- Real robot data (LegKilo) requires manual Google Drive download
- No synthetic data mixing with real datasets
- Committee recommendations saved in Agent_Reviews/

### Commands for Next Session

```bash
# Check PAMAP2 data
ls -la /mnt/ssd/Conv2d_Datasets/har_adapted/pamap2/PAMAP2_Dataset/Protocol/

# Process PAMAP2 for quadruped adaptation
python scripts/process_pamap2_quadruped.py  # Need to create

# Monitor storage usage
df -h /mnt/ssd

# Check dataset summary
cat /mnt/ssd/Conv2d_Datasets/REAL_DATASETS_M16.md
```
