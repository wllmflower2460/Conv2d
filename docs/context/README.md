- DeviceAttention (Phone+IMU fusion)
- EnhancedCrossSpeciesDataset (YAML-driven data pipeline)
- Training infrastructure with monitoring

### üöÄ **Implementation Path**
1. **Week 1**: VQ integration with existing encoder
2. **Week 2**: HDP clustering for automatic behavioral state discovery
3. **Week 3**: HSMM temporal dynamics with duration modeling
4. **Week 4**: Full integration with uncertainty quantification

### üìä **Performance Targets**
- **Technical**: <100ms latency, >85% accuracy, 5-15 behavioral clusters
- **Scientific**: Reproduce Kelso phase transitions, match Feldman synchrony patterns
- **Clinical**: Real-time feedback capability with calibrated uncertainty

### üî¨ **Novel Contribution**
**Behavioral-Dynamical Coherence**: I(Z;Œ¶) mutual information between discrete states and continuous phase dynamics - the first unified measure of synchrony quality.
