# Hailo Pipeline TCN Encoder Project Status & Next Actions
**Date**: 2025-08-31  
**Project**: https://github.com/wllmflower2460/hailo_pipeline  
**Status**: Active Development - Requires Attention Next Week  

## 📋 Current Project State

### **GitHub Repository Status**
- **Repository**: https://github.com/wllmflower2460/hailo_pipeline
- **Commits**: Minimal (3 commits) - Early development stage
- **Current Mode**: CPU-only due to GPU compatibility issues
- **Primary Issue**: AMD Radeon 780M integrated GPU not fully supported by ROCm
- **Infrastructure**: Containerized development environment with Jupyter integration

### **Obsidian Vault Documentation**
Based on comprehensive search of your notes, the project has extensive planning documentation:

#### **Core Technical Specifications**
- **Model**: TCN-VAE with 57.68% validation accuracy (production-ready)
- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi 5 + Hailo-8 accelerator (26 TOPS)
- **Input**: 9-axis IMU data, 100-timestep windows
- **Output**: 64-dimensional embeddings
- **Performance Target**: <50ms end-to-end latency
- **Model Size**: 4.4MB (`best_tcn_vae_57pct.pth`)

#### **Implementation Plan**
1. **ONNX Export**: Export encoder-only PyTorch model with fixed shape [1, 100, 9]
2. **DFC Compilation**: Use Hailo Dataflow Compiler to create .hef files
3. **HailoRT Sidecar**: FastAPI service with /healthz and /encode endpoints
4. **EdgeInfer Integration**: Docker Compose deployment for Pi-5

## 🚨 Critical Issues Requiring Attention

### **1. GPU Compatibility (High Priority)**
```bash
# Current Issue
"The AMD Radeon 780M integrated GPU is not fully supported by ROCm"
```
**Impact**: Development currently CPU-only, limiting training performance
**Next Actions**:
- Investigate ROCm 6.0+ compatibility with Radeon 780M
- Consider fallback to CUDA environment or cloud GPU training
- Update diagnostic scripts for better GPU detection

### **2. Documentation Gaps (Medium Priority)**
**Missing**:
- License information: "[Add license information here]"
- Contact information: "[Add contact information here]"
- Contribution guidelines for team development

### **3. Model Integration Pipeline (High Priority)**
**Current State**: Training models exist but deployment pipeline incomplete
**Gap**: Bridge between trained `best_tcn_vae_57pct.pth` model and Hailo .hef deployment
**Next Actions**:
- Complete ONNX export workflow
- Implement DFC compilation pipeline
- Create HailoRT Python sidecar

### **4. Active Development vs Documentation Drift**
**Risk**: Extensive Obsidian planning may be ahead of actual implementation
**Evidence**: 
- 57.68% accuracy model exists (from 2025-08-30 session)
- GitHub repo shows minimal commits
- Integration plan exists but implementation incomplete

## 📝 Next Week Action Plan

### **Phase 1: Repository Synchronization (Day 1-2)**
```bash
# Audit current state
git log --oneline  # Check actual commits vs documentation
git status         # Verify working directory state

# Sync with latest training results
# Copy best_tcn_vae_57pct.pth from TCN-VAE_models repo
# Update model versioning and tracking
```

### **Phase 2: GPU Environment Resolution (Day 2-3)**
```bash
# ROCm compatibility investigation
rocminfo           # Check current ROCm installation
rocm-smi          # AMD GPU status and utilization

# Alternative approaches
# Option A: Cloud GPU training (faster short-term)
# Option B: CUDA environment setup (if available)
# Option C: Optimize CPU-only workflow for now
```

### **Phase 3: Model Deployment Pipeline (Day 3-5)**
```bash
# ONNX export implementation
python scripts/export_tcn_encoder.py --model best_tcn_vae_57pct.pth
# Expected output: tcn_encoder_fixed_shape.onnx

# Hailo DFC compilation
hailo compile tcn_encoder_fixed_shape.onnx --config hailo_config.yaml
# Expected output: tcn_encoder.hef

# HailoRT sidecar testing
python sidecar/hailo_inference_server.py --hef tcn_encoder.hef
# Test endpoints: /healthz, /encode
```

## 🔄 Integration Points with Current EdgeInfer Work

### **Immediate Synergy**
Your EdgeInfer project already has:
- ✅ Feature flag architecture (`USE_REAL_MODEL=false`)
- ✅ HTTP client mocking for testing
- ✅ Session-based analysis workflow
- ✅ Docker Compose deployment ready

### **Integration Checklist**
- [ ] Update EdgeInfer sidecar URL to point to Hailo pipeline
- [ ] Implement TCN encoder endpoint in Hailo pipeline
- [ ] Add Hailo service to existing docker-compose.yml
- [ ] Update feature flag to enable real model inference
- [ ] Performance validation: <50ms latency requirement

## 📊 Success Metrics

### **Technical Milestones**
- [ ] GPU environment resolved (ROCm or alternative)
- [ ] ONNX export pipeline working
- [ ] .hef file successfully compiled
- [ ] HailoRT sidecar responding to /healthz and /encode
- [ ] End-to-end latency <50ms validated
- [ ] Integration with EdgeInfer docker-compose stack

### **Documentation Milestones**
- [ ] Repository README updated with current capabilities
- [ ] License and contact information completed
- [ ] Model versioning and deployment docs
- [ ] Performance benchmarks documented

## 💡 Strategic Recommendations

### **Short-term (Next Week)**
1. **Priority 1**: Resolve GPU compatibility - this blocks efficient development
2. **Priority 2**: Complete model deployment pipeline - bridge gap between training and deployment
3. **Priority 3**: Synchronize documentation with actual implementation

### **Medium-term (Following Weeks)**
1. Integrate with Pi-5 + Hailo-8 hardware setup
2. Implement active learning pipeline for continuous improvement
3. Performance optimization and benchmarking
4. Production deployment with EdgeInfer integration

### **Risk Mitigation**
- Keep CPU-only fallback working for development continuity
- Maintain feature flag architecture for safe production rollback
- Document known issues and workarounds clearly

This project has excellent theoretical foundation and clear technical goals, but needs focused implementation work to bridge the gap between planning and deployed capabilities.
