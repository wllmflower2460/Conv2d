# Cross-Domain Transfer Lab Protocol

## Experimental Checklist
- [ ] Collect synchronized human + quadruped IMU datasets.
- [ ] Perform IMU calibration (gravity, heading).
- [ ] Detect stride events, estimate phases (human heel-strike, dog paw contact).
- [ ] Compute invariant features (duty, COM oscillations, phase lags).
- [ ] Apply phase warping and invariant mapping to target gait.
- [ ] Decode quadruped limb sequences (HSMM with duration priors).
- [ ] Log calibration errors, constraint violations, and uncertainties.

## Validation Metrics
**Invariant Preservation**
- KL divergence between human invariants (mapped) and dog invariants (observed).
- Phase-lag error (degrees).
- Duty factor RMSE.

**Contact Sequence Validity**
- % strides with legal footfall order (target ≥ 95%).
- Duration distributions match reference (KS test).

**Dynamics & Spectrum**
- Correlation of COM vertical waveforms.
- Preservation of spectral ratio (fundamental:harmonics).

**Downstream Stability**
- HSMM/FSQ code utilization > baseline.
- ECE (Expected Calibration Error) reduced vs naïve mapping.
