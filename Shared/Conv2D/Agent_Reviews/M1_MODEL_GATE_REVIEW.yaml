  fairhall_critique: |
    The architecture shows promise but lacks rigorous validation of its core claims:
    1. Order parameters (VQ codes) need to emerge from dynamics, not be imposed
    2. Timescale separation between fast IMU and slow behaviors needs explicit modeling
    3. The 100-timestep window may alias important dynamics
    
  rao_critique: |
    From a probabilistic perspective, several issues need addressing:
    1. No explicit prior over behavioral sequences - HDP is non-parametric but not fully Bayesian
    2. Likelihood model unclear - how do IMU observations relate to latent states?
    3. Missing hierarchical inference - should integrate over possible clusterings

deployment_readiness:
  blocking_issues:
    - "ECE and conformal coverage requirements not met"
    - "No production monitoring or drift detection"
    - "Missing A/B testing framework for clinical validation"
    
  path_to_production:
    immediate: "Fix calibration and implement conformal prediction"
    short_term: "Validate on held-out clinical dataset"
    medium_term: "Deploy with human-in-the-loop oversight"
    long_term: "Autonomous operation after safety validation"

recommendation: |
  The Conv2d-VQ-HDP-HSMM model shows innovative architecture and promising initial results,
  but requires significant work before production deployment. The 78.12% accuracy and
  lack of proper calibration are blocking issues.
  
  Priority fixes:
  1. Implement proper calibration with ECE â‰¤ 3% target
  2. Add conformal prediction for 90% coverage guarantee
  3. Reduce codebook size or adjust hyperparameters for target perplexity
  4. Conduct ablation studies to justify architectural complexity
  5. Validate biological plausibility with domain experts
  
  The model should not proceed to deployment (L1 gate) until calibration requirements
  are met and accuracy improves to at least 85% (compromise target).
