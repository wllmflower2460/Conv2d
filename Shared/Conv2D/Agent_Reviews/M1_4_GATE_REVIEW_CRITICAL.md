# M1.4 Model Gate Review - CRITICAL FINDINGS

## ðŸ”´ GATE STATUS: **FAILED**

**Review Date**: September 22, 2025  
**Committee Score**: 2.1/5  
**Recommendation**: STOP deployment, return to proper evaluation

## Executive Summary

The synchrony-advisor-committee has identified **catastrophic methodological flaws** that completely invalidate the claimed 99.95% accuracy. The model shows only **6.93% accuracy on real data** (random chance level), indicating total failure to learn meaningful behavioral representations.

## Critical Blockers

### 1. ðŸš¨ **Data Leakage & Invalid Evaluation**

**SEVERITY: BLOCKER**

The evaluation uses the **exact same data generation function** for both training and testing:
- Same random seed (42) for train and test
- Same synthetic pattern generator function
- No temporal separation
- Perfectly separable deterministic patterns

**Evidence**:
```python
# From deploy_m13_fsq.py line 101
test_dataset = _create_synthetic_behavioral_dataset(150, seed=42)
# Same function, same seed used for training data
```

**Impact**: The 99.95% accuracy is meaningless - the model memorized the data generation process, not behavioral dynamics.

### 2. ðŸš¨ **Real Performance: ~7% (Random Guessing)**

**SEVERITY: BLOCKER**

When evaluated on actual data:
- `m13_results_20250922_005153.json`: **6.93% accuracy**
- Expected random baseline for 10 classes: 10%
- Model performs **worse than random** on real behavioral data

**Gap**: 99.95% (synthetic) â†’ 6.93% (real) = **93% performance drop**

### 3. ðŸš¨ **Calibration Metrics Invalid**

**SEVERITY: BLOCKER**

- ECE 2.3% computed on synthetic data
- Conformal coverage 91% meaningless without real distribution
- Temperature scaling won't transfer to real data

**Risk**: False confidence in clinical deployment could lead to harmful interventions.

## Required Immediate Actions

### 1. **STOP All Deployment Activities**
- No production deployment
- No clinical trials
- No beta testing
- Acknowledge evaluation flaws publicly

### 2. **Obtain Real Behavioral Data**
Choose one:
- Original quadruped IMU dataset (78.12% baseline exists)
- Validated HAR datasets (WISDM, PAMAP2, etc.)
- New animal behavioral recordings

### 3. **Create Proper Evaluation Protocol**
```python
# Required approach
train_data = generate_data(seed=42, start_time=0, end_time=70)
val_data = generate_data(seed=123, start_time=70, end_time=85)  
test_data = generate_data(seed=456, start_time=85, end_time=100)
# Different seeds, temporal separation, independent generation
```

### 4. **Honest Performance Reporting**
Expected realistic metrics on real data:
- Accuracy: 60-80% (not 99.95%)
- ECE: 5-10% (not 2.3%)
- Latency: Include CPU post-processing overhead

## Committee Assessments

### Statistical Validity (Score: 1.5/5)
> "This is textbook overfitting to the data generation process. The model has learned the synthetic pattern generator, not behavioral dynamics." - Fairhall

### Theoretical Foundations (Score: 2.8/5)
> "The synthetic data contains no phase transitions or bifurcations. This is like training a weather model on sine waves and claiming hurricane prediction capability." - Kelso

### Clinical Safety (Score: 1.2/5)
> "Calibration on synthetic data provides false confidence for clinical deployment. This could lead to dangerous therapeutic decisions. Absolutely unacceptable." - Koole & Tschacher

### Deployment Readiness (Score: 2.0/5)
> "Model will fail catastrophically on real data based on 6.93% accuracy. No drift detection. False confidence could harm end users." - Systems Review

## Positive Findings

Despite critical flaws, some technical achievements:
1. âœ… FSQ architecture properly implemented (no collapse)
2. âœ… Hailo compilation successful (785KB HEF)
3. âœ… Split processing solution for Round operation works
4. âœ… Low latency achieved (9ms on synthetic data)

## Path Forward: M1.5 Requirements

### Minimum Criteria for M1.5 Gate Pass

1. **Real Data Evaluation**
   - No synthetic data allowed
   - Minimum 1000 real behavioral sequences
   - Proper train/val/test splits (60/20/20)

2. **Honest Metrics**
   - Report actual accuracy (likely 60-80%)
   - Compute ECE on same data as accuracy
   - Include CPU post-processing in latency

3. **Temporal Validation**
   - Validate HSMM on real temporal sequences
   - Show duration modeling improves accuracy
   - Test on multi-day recordings

4. **Documentation**
   - Acknowledge M1.4 evaluation flaws
   - Document all data sources clearly
   - Provide reproducible evaluation code

### Realistic Timeline

- **Weeks 1-2**: Obtain and preprocess real behavioral data
- **Weeks 3-4**: Retrain model with proper methodology
- **Weeks 5-6**: Rigorous evaluation and calibration
- **Week 7**: M1.5 Gate Review

Expected realistic performance:
- Accuracy: 70-80%
- ECE: <10%
- Coverage: 85-90%
- Latency: 15-20ms (including CPU)

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong
1. Used identical data generation for train and test
2. Claimed 99.95% without real data validation
3. Mixed synthetic and real evaluations
4. Ignored 93% performance gap warning sign

### How to Prevent This
1. Always use independent test data
2. Validate on real data before any claims
3. Be suspicious of >95% accuracy
4. Use different random seeds for train/val/test
5. Apply temporal separation for time series

## Conclusion

The Conv2d-FSQ architecture shows promise, but the evaluation methodology completely undermines credibility. The 99.95% accuracy claim is based on **memorization of synthetic patterns**, not learning of behavioral dynamics.

**The model must be completely re-evaluated on real data before any progression.**

### Risk Level: **CRITICAL**
- Deployment would fail immediately
- Could harm users with wrong predictions
- Would destroy project credibility

### Recommendation: **RETURN TO BASICS**
1. Real data
2. Proper splits  
3. Honest metrics
4. Scientific rigor

**Note**: This review may seem harsh, but it's better to fail at the gate than fail in production with potential harm to users. The FSQ architecture has potential - it just needs proper validation.
