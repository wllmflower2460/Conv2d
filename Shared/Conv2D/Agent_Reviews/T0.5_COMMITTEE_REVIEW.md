# T0.5 Theory Gate Committee Review
**Date**: 2025-09-24  
**Gate**: T0.5 (Theory Completion)  
**Score**: 3.6/5 ðŸŸ¡  
**Status**: CONDITIONAL PASS (pending critical fixes)  
**Reviewer**: Synchrony Advisory Committee

---

## Executive Summary

The T0.5 submission demonstrates substantial theoretical progress with proper corrections to MI computation, FSQ optimization, and behavioral alignment. However, validation on synthetic data (100% accuracy) is insufficient for behavioral claims, and quadruped reference data (n=287) is critically inadequate for cross-species validation. The framework shows promise with 72% intent classification and excellent calibration (ECE=0.085), but requires real data validation and scope clarification before full gate passage.

## Critical Issues (BLOCKERS)

### 1. Synthetic Validation Insufficiency â›”
**Issue**: FSQ ablation showing 100% accuracy on synthetic data does not validate real behavioral capture
**Impact**: Core hypothesis (discrete states capture behavior) remains unproven
**Required Fix**: 
- Run ablation on real PAMAP2 test split with proper train/test isolation
- Include statistical power analysis (n>30 per condition)
- Report effect sizes (Cohen's d > 0.5)

### 2. Quadruped Data Crisis â›”
**Issue**: Only n=287 sequences insufficient for cross-species claims (need n>500 minimum)
**Impact**: Cannot validate behavioral alignment hypothesis
**Options**:
1. Expand to n>1000 sequences from multiple dogs
2. Rescope to human-only validation for T0.5
3. Position quadruped as future pilot work

---

## Major Concerns

### 3. HDP Integration Failure ðŸ”´
**Evidence**: FSQ alone: 100% â†’ FSQ+HDP: 48.3% (52% accuracy drop!)
**Analysis**: Fundamental architectural incompatibility, not tuning issue
**Action**: Debug FSQâ†’HDP gradient flow or justify HDP removal

### 4. Codebook Over-parameterization ðŸŸ¡
**Evidence**: 7.4% utilization, perplexity 1.15 â†’ need ~10 codes, not 512
**Impact**: 50x over-parameterization wastes resources
**Fix**: Sweep [8, 16, 32, 64] codes, select minimum maintaining >70% accuracy

### 5. Placeholder Transfer Entropy ðŸŸ¡
```python
te = torch.tensor(0.1 + 0.05 * torch.randn(1).item())  # INVALID
```
**Impact**: Directionality claims completely unsupported
**Fix**: Implement actual k-NN estimator or use JIDT library

## Strengths Acknowledged âœ…

### Theoretical Framework
- Von Mises MI properly handles discrete-continuous mixture
- Rate-distortion FSQ mathematically sound
- Behavioral alignment correctly abandons kinematic transfer

### Implementation Quality
- 313K parameter model deployment-ready
- ECE = 0.085 excellent calibration
- Sub-100ms inference achievable

### Integration Completeness
- Full pipeline demonstrated
- All T0.1-T0.4 corrections incorporated
- Multi-factor uncertainty model sophisticated

---

## Statistical Requirements

### Missing Elements
1. **No Bonferroni Correction**: Need Î± = 0.05/6 = 0.0083 for 6 tests
2. **No Effect Sizes**: Report Cohen's d, Î·Â², Ï‰Â² for all comparisons
3. **No Power Analysis**: Justify sample sizes for meaningful differences
4. **Temporal Dependence**: Account for autocorrelation in splits

### Required Additions
- K-fold cross-validation with variance estimates
- Confidence intervals for all metrics
- Confusion matrices with per-class performance
- Domain shift testing (different sensors/placements)

## Detailed Scoring

| Component | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **Theory** | 3.8/5 | Sound framework, but validation gaps |
| **Methods** | 3.5/5 | Good design, poor execution on real data |
| **Calibration** | 4.2/5 | Excellent ECE, proper uncertainty |
| **Latency** | 4.5/5 | Sub-100ms achievable, Hailo-ready |
| **Replicability** | 3.0/5 | Incomplete data package, placeholder code |
| **Ethics** | 3.6/5 | Limited discussion of limitations |

## Required Actions for T0.5 Passage

### Week 1 Deliverables (CRITICAL)
1. âœ… Complete FSQ ablation on real PAMAP2 splits
2. âœ… Optimize codebook to 32-64 codes
3. âœ… Debug or remove HDP component
4. âœ… Implement actual von Mises MI (not placeholder)
5. âœ… Document expert evaluation protocol with IRR

### Week 2 Deliverables
1. Statistical rigor (Bonferroni, effect sizes, power)
2. Cross-validation stability analysis
3. Failure mode characterization
4. Either acquire n>1000 quadruped sequences OR rescope

### Documentation Requirements
- Expert evaluation rubric with inter-rater reliability
- Complete statistical analysis plan
- Limitations explicitly stated
- Future work clearly scoped

---

## Committee Recommendations

### Immediate Path Forward
1. **Rescope to human-only** for T0.5 passage (faster)
2. Position quadruped as D1/P1 future work
3. Focus on proving discrete state validity first

### Alternative Path (if maintaining cross-species)
1. Acquire n>1000 quadruped sequences immediately
2. Partner with veterinary behavior lab
3. Delay T0.5 by 2-3 weeks for data collection

### Statistical Strengthening
```python
required_analyses = {
    'power': "G*Power analysis for n determination",
    'effect': "Cohen's d > 0.5 for practical significance",
    'correction': "Bonferroni Î± = 0.0083",
    'stability': "5-fold CV with std reporting",
    'robustness': "Noise injection 10%, 20%, 30%"
}
```

## Key Questions for PI

1. **Scope Decision**: Will you rescope to human-only for T0.5, or commit to acquiring n>1000 quadruped sequences?

2. **HDP Necessity**: Given 52% accuracy drop, is HDP theoretically essential or can it be removed?

3. **Timeline**: Can you complete required fixes in 1 week, or need 2-week extension?

4. **Collaboration**: Do you have access to veterinary behavior lab for quadruped data?

---

## Verdict

**Status**: ðŸŸ¡ **CONDITIONAL PASS**

**Conditions**:
1. Complete real data validation (not synthetic)
2. Resolve quadruped data insufficiency (expand or rescope)
3. Fix HDP integration or justify removal
4. Implement actual MI computation
5. Add proper statistical rigor

**Timeline**: 
- 1 week for critical fixes
- 2 weeks if maintaining cross-species scope

The theoretical framework is sound and nearly ready. Focus on real validation to prove discrete state hypothesis, then extend to cross-species in future gates. Current 72% intent accuracy and 0.085 ECE are promising indicators once properly validated.
