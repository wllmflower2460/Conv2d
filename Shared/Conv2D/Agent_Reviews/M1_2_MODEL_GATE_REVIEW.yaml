  feldman_perspective: |
    The discrete FSQ codes align with behavioral state concepts, but duration
    distributions need validation against actual bout lengths. HSMM component
    addresses this theoretically but lacks empirical validation.

recommendation: |
  **CONDITIONAL PASS** to M1.3 with critical requirements.
  
  The transition from VQ to FSQ successfully resolves the codebook collapse blocker,
  demonstrating architectural resilience and maintaining accuracy. The ablation study
  provides clear evidence that HDP should be removed and FSQ+HSMM is optimal.
  
  However, two critical gaps remain:
  1. **Calibration**: Implementation exists but not integrated with FSQ model
  2. **Accuracy**: 78.12% remains significantly below 90% target
  
  The FSQ architecture is fundamentally sound and production-viable. With focused
  effort on calibration integration and accuracy improvement through data augmentation,
  the model can reach deployment readiness.
  
  **Specific M1.3 Success Criteria**:
  1. ECE â‰¤3% computed on FSQ model outputs
  2. Conformal coverage validated at 90% (Â±2%)
  3. Accuracy â‰¥85% on quadruped behavioral data
  4. HDP component removed from production pipeline
  5. Latency benchmarked at <100ms on Hailo-8
  
  **Risk Assessment**: 
  - Low risk for architecture (FSQ proven stable)
  - Medium risk for calibration (code exists, needs integration)
  - High risk for accuracy (may require significant training improvements)
  
  The project shows strong progress resolving architectural issues but must
  prioritize calibration and accuracy improvements for deployment readiness.
