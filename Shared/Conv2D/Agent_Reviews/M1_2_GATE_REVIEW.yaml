executive_summary: |
  The M1.2 checkpoint demonstrates significant architectural improvements with the successful
  transition from VQ to FSQ (Finite Scalar Quantization), resolving the critical codebook
  collapse blocker. The comprehensive ablation study provides clear evidence for architectural
  decisions, particularly that HDP should be removed. However, calibration remains unintegrated
  and accuracy plateaus at 78.12%.

      FSQ addresses order parameter concerns by providing stable discrete states
      without learning dynamics. However, the fixed quantization grid may miss
      critical behavioral transitions.

    comment: |
      HDP's unsupervised clustering clearly conflicts with supervised objectives -
      removal is justified. Calibration implementation exists but needs integration.

    comment: |
      Consider motor control priors - behaviors have physical constraints that
      could improve accuracy. The HSMM duration modeling needs validation against
      actual bout lengths.

      Clinical deployment requires calibrated uncertainties. The current calibration
      gap is unacceptable for therapeutic applications.

final_recommendation: |
  CONDITIONAL PASS to M1.3 with mandatory requirements.
  
  The FSQ transition successfully resolves the critical architectural issues,
  providing a stable, non-collapsing quantization mechanism. The ablation study
  definitively shows FSQ+HSMM as optimal.
  
  However, the model cannot proceed to L1 deployment without:
  1. Full calibration integration (2-3 days effort)
  2. Accuracy improvements to ‚â•85% (1-2 weeks with augmentation)
  3. Latency validation on target hardware (2-3 days)
  
  The project demonstrates strong engineering progress but must prioritize
  calibration integration and accuracy improvements for production readiness.
