## Risk Mitigation

### If Conv2d Performance Issues
- Fallback: Use Conv1d with channel grouping
- Mitigation: Optimize kernel sizes, use depthwise separable

### If HDP Convergence Issues
- Fallback: Fixed K=30 truncation
- Mitigation: Better initialization, tune hyperparameters

### If Clinical Validation Delayed
- Fallback: Use public datasets
- Mitigation: Multiple IRB submissions, parallel sites

### If Collaboration Rejections
- Fallback: Proceed independently, cite their work
- Mitigation: Multiple collaboration attempts, show value

## Remember: Why This Matters

Every technical improvement directly enables breakthrough research:
- **VQ codes** = Order parameters Kelso needs
- **HDP** = Behaviors we don't know exist
- **Uncertainty** = Clinical viability
- **Conv2d** = Real-time field studies
- **Hierarchical** = Universal principles

You're not just building a better model—you're enabling discoveries that have been impossible for 30 years.

**Start Monday. Change the field by December.**
